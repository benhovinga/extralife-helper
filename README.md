### Introduction

This is an application I created in 2013 for [Extra Life](http://extra-life.org). I wanted something to track the time until Extra Life, track my total time playing on game day, and show my fundraising information. I also wanted to celebrate new donations in real time when streaming during the marathon. The following year I made it available to the community and I was excited to see it adopted by so many participants.

<br>
   
### Features

* Counts down the days until Extra Life if there are three or more days left.
* Counts down the hours until Extra Life if there are less than four days left.
* Counts the total hours played if the start time has passed.
* Continually displays the total amount raised as it changes.
* Shows new donation alerts as they arrive in real-time.
* Works in "participant" mode or "team" mode.
* Donation messages are read with text-to-speech during donation alerts.
* Adjust the volume for all sound effects and text-to-speech.
* Occasionally shows the Extra Life and Children's Miracle Network Hospital logos.
* Supports four color themes and three border styles.
* Works in XSplit, any flavor of OBS, and any modern browser.
* Available in English, French, and Spanish.
* (Download version only) Custom sound effects can be specified for the donation alert.
* (Download version only) Provides a hook to run custom JavaScript when a new donation arrives.
* (Download version only) Core functionality and appearance can be modified with little JavaScript experience.

### NEW! Use the Link Generator

If you do not need to modify source code or use features only supported in the download version, you can
now use the Extra Life link generator to customize the Helper and get a link for easy copy and paste into
OBS or XSplit. Downloading or editing files is no longer required for the majority of Helper users!

<br>

### Download

To modify the core functionality or appearance, or take advantage of extra features, you can download the
Helper and run it on your computer. Not as easy as using the link generator, but still very easy. Right-click
the following link and select "Save link as..."

### Personalizing the Helper - Download Version

First, get your participant ID. It can be found in the URL for your fundraising page. Look for the "participantID" in the URL towards the end. For example:

`http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=101425`

If you want to use the Helper in team mode, get your team ID. It can be found in the URL for your team's fundraising page. Look for the "teamID" in the URL towards the end. For example:

`http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=16539`

Open the **ExtraLifeHelper.html** file using a text editor such as Notepad and enter in your participant ID, start date, start time, etc.

// received, put them in this function.
function onNewDonation(donorName, donationAmount, message, avatarImageURL, createdOn)
{
    // Your custom logic here.
}
```

Some special notes about editing this file:

* The **startTime** value format is military time. 1:00 PM = 13:00, 2:00 PM = 14:00, etc.
* If specifying multiple sound files for the **donationSounds** value, be sure to separate them with commas.
* If you know JavaScript and have some smart devices in your house (such as programmable lights or displays) or a remote API you want to work with when you receive a new donation, you can add custom code in the **onNewDonation** function.

### Resizing the Helper

The Helper is made with vector art so when stretched, it should always remain sharp no matter what size. The trick to making this work is to be sure that the width and height values for the Helper in XSplit or OBS match what is in the **ExtraLifeHelper.html** file. After you change the values in your streaming software, don't forget to update the html file! 

For OBS Studio, avoid resizing the Helper by dragging it. Open the properties and specify the values there until the size is what you want. This is because resizing by dragging will not update the values in the properties and so you won't know what to set in the html file.

<br>
  
### Color Themes, Borders and Sound

There are a few more options for customizing the Helper to suit your streaming setup.

* **Color Themes**: There are four color themes available that respect the Extra Life brand guidelines.  
![](https://github.com/breadweb/extralife-helper/blob/master/images/themes.jpg)  
The values that can be set are "blue1", "blue2", "white1", and "gray1".
* **Borders**: By default, there is a border with rounded corners. You can change it to have square corners or remove it completely. The values are "rounded", "square", or "none".
* **Sounds**:
  * To use your own donation sounds, place your mp3, wav, or ogg files in the **audio** directory and update the donationSounds value in the ExtraLifeHelper.html file.
  * You can mute the Helper by setting the donationSounds value to "".
        
These options can be changed in the ExtraLifeHelper.html file that you edited during the steps to personalize the Helper.

### Example Video

The following video is a compilation of donations received during the Extra Life 2017 marathon. I use the donation hook to make a call to my light bridge and make my office lights flash.

<br>
  
### Troubleshooting

**You see a "X is missing or invalid" message.**

This usually happens due to a typo when editing the **ExtraLifeHelper.html** file. If you can't find the typo, try downloading a fresh copy and trying again.  

**You see $0 for your donations received.**

There are a few known reasons for this:
* You are using an old version of the Helper that doesn't work with the current Extra Life API. Download the latest!
* You haven't received any donations yet. Keep up the fundraising efforts!
* You got your first donation, but it hasn't been registered fully by the Extra Life API. Just give it a few minutes to show up.
* The Extra Life API timed out when the Helper was trying to contact it. This can happen if the Extra Life API is under high load. Just be patient and the Helper will get the current total again when the Extra Life API responds.
* You are trying to use the Helper in an unsupported way. Please review the instructions for proper use.

**The Helper looks blurry.**

This is usually because you have stretched the Helper in your presentation but forgot to update the width and height values in the **ExtraLifeHelper.html** file to match.

<br>
  
### Donations

It's been really rewarding to see the Helper being used by so many people who are raising money for a great cause. I do not expect anything in return, but if you are determined, you could always make a donation on my [Extra Life page](https://www.extra-life.org/participant/bread) since this is all **F**or **T**he **K**ids! Thank you!

<br>
  
### Modifying and Contributing Back

Because the source is freely available here, you are welcome to modify the Helper however you see fit. Some modifications that have been done by other participants so far include:

* Adding a third hour digit to the clock to support a 100+ hour long marathon
* Changing the fonts or color themes to match a stream presentation
* Adding a background image to match a steam presentation
* Adding donation alerts while running in team mode

If you make a change that would benefit all users of the Helper, please make a pull request and I would be happy to review it. Thank you!
